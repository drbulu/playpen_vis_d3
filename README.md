## Overview

This is an exploration of the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and its potential. The aim is to become familiar with this important framework by messing with the various [tutorial materials](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Tutorials) that have been generously contributed by others. Then I will be able to understand and apply it to projects where it can add value. Above all, this repo aims to be structured... but not formal, so that fun and exploration can be nurtured to give me useful insights... let's go then :smile:
